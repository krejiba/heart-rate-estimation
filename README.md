# Heart rate estimation| SciPy
This is a personal project using Python. Using classical digital signal processing techniques, we can estimate the heart rate of a subject given a signal acquired from an electrocardiogram (ECG).  

### How to use :
You need to download all the files in your working directory. Make sure to install NumPy and SciPy in order to make use of this code. 
You need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can use the notebook by typing `jupyter notebook ecg.ipynb` in the command line. A new window will open in your browser.  
You can run all code by clicking on "Cell" -> "Run All".
